# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Website Improvement SaaS platform that uses AI-powered analysis to help small business owners improve their websites. The platform will analyze existing websites using Firecrawl, generate AI-driven improvement suggestions, provide guided editing capabilities, and offer one-click deployment options. The system follows a freemium model with credit-based limitations to encourage conversion to paid plans.

6. IF the preview fails to load THEN the system SHALL show fallback content and error handling

### Requirement 4: Guided Editing Interface
